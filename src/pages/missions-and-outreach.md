Our Outreach is made up of three groups. We reach out Locally, National and world wide as we seek to make Jesus's name known.

**What is Acts 1:8?** Acts 1:8 ministry is the model we are using to give structure and organization to our outreach here at FBC Bronson. With this we endeavor to reach Jerusalem (Bronson and Levy County), Judea and Samaria (Florida and the US), and to the ends of the Earth. Our fellowships (**the last Monday of every month**) Will be a time to hear from a ministry we do or support and how we can help, pray, give or go. With our three teams we hope everyone finds a place to serve how God is calling them to be a part of the great calling we have to share His love at home and around the Globe.

**Jerusalem/Judea Team**

_Geographical responsibility: Levy county/Florida_

Supported Ministries include: Bronson Kids Clothes Closet, Harmony pregnancy center, Children's table, Bronson Bags and Fall festival.

**Samaria Team**

_Geographical responsibility: The United States_

**Ends of the Earth Team**

_Geographical responsibility: The rest of the world_

### Our next Acts 1:8 Fellowship is on August 31st

**Our very special guest speaker is:** Christa K. Lynn Survivor Leader, Anti-Trafficking Advocate, National Speaker

Christa K. Lynn passionately stands beside survivors of trafficking as they overcome vulnerabilities, obstacles and injustices to build dream-worthy lives. She earned her masterâ€™s degree from Liberty University, is a licensed mental health counselor in the state of Florida, a certified clinical trauma professional and founded an organization providing direct services to adult trafficking survivors in southwest Florida. As a respected leader in the anti-trafficking movement, Christa is grateful to share her experience as a second-generation trafficking survivor with those who share her passion for seeing the lives of exploited children, teens and young adults changed.
