## Bronson Kids is preparing kids for the road ahead.

Your child will learn that God loves them, they can trust him no matter what, and they should love others as Jesus loves them.

## Join us for Pioneer Clubs on Wednesday evenings. 

We serve **supper at 5:30 p.m**. and begin our club meeting at 6:00. Parents pick up their children from the back of the church at 7:30. This club is available for children Pre-K through 5th grade.

Pioneer Clubs’ mission is training up children and youth to follow Christ in every aspect of life by providing **biblically-based** and educationally sound resources. Our Christ-centered programs integrate spiritual and personal development to help boys and girls **build healthy relationships** with caring Christian adults, peers, and, most importantly, Christ. 

Churches choose Pioneer Clubs for its participative Bible study, Scripture memory, life skills training, and emphasis on relational discipleship and outreach.
