We are so excited for everyone to see the hard work and donations of so many people to remodel our children’s area. I can’t wait for the kids to see it!

It's called Bible Blvd because we have created storefronts for many of the most familiar bible characters. Such as: Mary’s essential oils, Samson’s Gym, Adam's rib shack, Lydia’s fabrics and so many more. You will love to walk down and see all the detail that has been put into this project.

**Special Thanks to:** Jeannie McCrickard, Cindy Pharis, Duncan and Edwina Azbell, Jennifer and Sidney Bray, Mac Huber, Gwen Hardison, Dane Shewey, Madi and JT Coker, Ted and Ned Rhude, Rex Shevitski, Frank McKoy, Mike and Carrie Neller and Jerry Harvey.

Children's activities are temporarily suspended due to COVID 19
