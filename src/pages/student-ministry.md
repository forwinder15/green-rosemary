> ### Our Student ministry is designed to help middle school and high school students grow their faith, their character, and their relationships

### **Wednesdays**

### 6:15 p.m. Youth Worship in the old sanctuary

Each week we meet on Wednesday night and have games, fun, worship, and learning from grades 6 to 12. We also have lots of fun activities and places to serve and each year we make our way to summer camp. Your student will have a blast and grow as a believer. Get connected today!
