### What is Celebrate Recovery (CR)? 

CR is a Christ-centered recovery group. It follows a 12-step recovery program that integrates biblical principles to love, heal and educate hurting people. CR helps people overcome their hurts, hang-ups and habits in a safe environment with people who love and support them. Most importantly, they will learn to trust God for their healing so they can experience a closer relationship with the only one who can truly help them understand themselves--Jesus Christ. 

### Who is CR for? 

Anyone who is struggling with life’s hurts, hang-ups or habits, whether Christian or not. 

### What are hurts, hang-ups and habits? 

The “3Hs” can be broadly defined as anything that gets in the way of a fruitful relationship with Christ and others and prevents us from living an overcoming life in Him. They can be deeply interconnected, with habits originating from hang-ups or hurts, or they may be standalone issues. Hurts represent people, places or events from our past (or present) that have left a negative mark on us. It is a wound that still affects us despite our efforts to ignore it or forget it. We may not even know that we have an underlying hurt, since we often repress these feelings as adults or the events surrounding the source were too complex for us to understand. A hurt typically originates from outside of us; things we had little or no control over. 

Examples include: 

• abuse • unhealthy relationships • crimes committed against us • injustices we’ve suffered • emotionally unavailable parents • betrayal • divorce 

Hang-ups can be inappropriate or negative responses or reactions to situations in life. These may manifest as character defects or negative behavior patterns. They can reflect coping mechanisms that developed during childhood and were carried over into adulthood. They may also be a reflection of rebellious, selfish or proud attitudes. 

Examples include: 

• anger • jealousy • poor life decisions • short temper • sarcasm • pride • depression • co-dependence • road rage 

Habits are repetitive actions or behaviors, most often associated with addictions. Habitual activities are usually negative and can tear us away from our walk with the Lord. These afflictions are an obvious outward expression of inner turmoil and underlying hurts. 

Examples include: 

• chemical addictions (drugs/alcohol/smoking) • pornography/sexual addictions • excessive exercise • food addictions • gambling • shopping addiction • online gaming 

### What are the 12 steps? 

Originally established by the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous, they are 12 actions, or steps, taken on the road to recovery that facilitate healing and sobriety. They have been adapted by many recovery and support groups. In CR, they are taught in lessons during large group meetings along with the 8 biblical principles. In addition to the weekly large group and share groups, the 12 steps are also taught in-depth as a mentored/sponsored step study class. When a person successfully completes a step study class they are then usually prepared to serve in leadership roles in CR and contribute significantly to other ministries. The step study groups, through working the 12 steps, can produce the most profound healing in the program. 

### What are the components of the Program? 

• Praise and worship • teaching and testimonies • fellowship • confidential share/support groups • step study classes • chips/tokens to “celebrate” our recoveries • accountability partners • sponsorship • service opportunities in CR 

### What is CR really about? 

Hurts, hang-ups and habits keep us in bondage. CR is a unique discipleship program designed to love people with the truth and produce effective Christians who can serve God without boundaries. If they are not Christian, then they probably will be by the time they have worked the 12 steps! Our hope is that participants will surrender their lives and wills over to the care of God. Throughout the process, and especially afterward, God is able to use their pain and brokenness to bring others to Him and serve His kingdom.
