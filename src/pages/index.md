    ### **Coronavirus Update**

    Dear Church Family,

    We want to take a few minutes of your time to update you on what's happening at our Church as we navigate the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community.

    We have decided to temporarily suspend activities in our church **through April 10, 2020.** This decision from our church leadership stems from an abundance of caution and a deep concern for the well-being of our community.

    We will instead be having **”Drive in Church”** service on **Sunday at 10am to 11.** Where you can stay right in your car and enjoy an outdoor service. You will be able to tune your FM radio in so you can hear it.

    Please make plans to join us for this fun and unique way to experience church together.

    There will also be many streaming opportunities. Make sure to follow out Facebook for more info.

    We will evaluate this decision early next week. Please know that your families will continue to be in our prayers as we navigate these circumstances together.

    As we share information via social media, please help spread the word and share it with your friends. Please remain in prayer for everyone that is being affected, and we will keep each of you informed as we move forward.
