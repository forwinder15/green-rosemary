#### **Our church’s mission is to connect people to Jesus.** Being a part of a faith community provides a wonderful opportunity for this to happen

#### In our groups we learn God’s Word, care for each other, praise God for who He is and what He’s done, and pray to God for His help and guidance

#### It’s our hope, that through the meaningful relationships formed in our groups, everyone can grow in their faith

#### The Best way to connect with a group is to join one of our Sunday School classes during the 9:15 AM hour on Sunday Mornings
