Bronson First Baptist is a place where everyone is welcome to worship, engage in a life-giving community, and serve others. We believe in creating a space where people can have authentic encounters with Christ, discover their gifts, and use them for God's glory.

## What Happens In A Service?

Our services last around 1 hour and 15 Minutes —as short as 60 minutes and as long as 75 minutes. We sing songs Hymns and Contemporary Worship songs. The sermon lasts about 30 - 45 minutes and uses scripture to teach its points.

## How Should I Dress?

You'll see everything from jeans to suits at Now Church. Dress up or dress comfortably, and either way, you will fit in!

## What do My Kids Do?

We offer Children's Church for children age three through 5th grade as well as nurseries (infants, crawlers, walkers—newborn through age 2) during our worship services. Our parent paging system and secure kids area will allow you to have peace of mind during services. And, our Jesus-centered kids programming is so fun and engaging your kids will beg to come back!

## Will I Be Asked to give money?

We do have an offering in our worship service, but it is for our members. If you are a visitor/guest, please do not feel obligated to give.
